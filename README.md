# Vision Transformers for Semantic Segmentation of Cardiac MRI

**Build Status**: *[Add your badge for build status or CI tools]*  

This repository contains a semantic segmentation system for cardiac MRI images using Vision Transformers (ViTs), hybrid architectures, and fully convolutional networks. The project explores performance metrics like accuracy, throughput, and sensitivity to hyperparameters for each architecture.

The work is part of a research project at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, focusing on leveraging cutting-edge techniques for medical image segmentation.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: Cardiac MRI segmentation dataset, with patient-specific data.
- **Model Architectures**: 
  - Vision Transformers (ViTs)  
  - Hybrid Models (ViT + CNNs)
  - Fully Convolutional Networks (CNN-based models)
- **Metrics**: Evaluation based on accuracy, IoU, and Dice coefficient.
- **Pretrained Models**: Utilizes pretrained models like DenseNet for transfer learning.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to execute the pipeline:

### 1. Data Preparation

Organize your dataset as follows:

```
data/
├── training
│   ├── patient001/
│   │   ├── patient001_frame01.nii.gz
│   │   └── patient001_frame01_gt.nii.gz
│   └── ...
└── testing
    ├── patient101/
    │   ├── patient101_frame01.nii.gz
    │   └── patient101_frame01_gt.nii.gz
    └── ...
```

### 2. Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to normalize data and split it into training/validation/testing:
```bash
python preprocess.py --config conf/preprocessing.cfg
```

### 3. Training

Train the model using the configuration file:
```bash
python train.py --config conf/train_vit.cfg
```

**Alternatives**:
- For hybrid models: `conf/train_hybrid.cfg`
- For CNN-based models: `conf/train_cnn.cfg`

### 4. Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best_model.pth --data data/testing/
```

### 5. Visualization

Visualize segmentation outputs:
```bash
python visualize.py --input data/testing/patient101_frame01.nii.gz --model checkpoints/best_model.pth
```
